Smart Hostel Room Allocation System – Full Project Description

Project Overview

The Smart Hostel Room Allocation System is a web-based platform that automates the entire hostel management process. It replaces manual allocation using registers and spreadsheets with a digital solution where students can apply for rooms, administrators can assign rooms, track occupancy, handle complaints, and manage fees.

This system improves transparency, reduces administrative workload, and ensures efficient hostel operations.
